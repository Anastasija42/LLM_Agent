Hi, and welcome!

In this demo, I'll show you the LLM Agent API's simple command functionalities,
 all within the "example_dir" folder.
 You'll see how it navigates directories, finds and renames files,
 and searches content—handling each request asynchronously and safely.

Plus, it passes all pylint and mypy checks, except for auto-generated Poetry files.

Let’s get started!
